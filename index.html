         <h1>A 3-Day Convention!</h1>
      </header>

      <p> This summer, beginning on Friday, July 14, 2023 through Sunday, July 16, 2023, at the The Liacouras Center in Philadelphia, PA.  I attended a 3 day convention entitled, "Exercise Patience!"<br> Ironically, my name means Patience Matters, it was a much needed and timely convention. Patience is a quality that I am continuously working on and will continue to work on :-).<br><br>
